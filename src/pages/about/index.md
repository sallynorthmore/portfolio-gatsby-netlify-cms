# About me

## Work

I have worked in digital for ten years now and enjoy building UIs in both freelance and permanent roles.

I like to work on a range of ventures, from smaller, visually creative projects to large, thoughtful, design systems.

Please contact me [here](/contact) for the quickest response, or via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sally-northmore-5568489/).

## Life

In my free time, I focus on horticulture and gardening, environmentalism, running, playing piano, theatre, comedy and the outdoors generally.

Currently I run a project called [The Switch](http:theswitch.org), where I document our householdâ€™s transition away from its dependence on plastic, towards a less throwaway life. Itâ€™s a particular goal of mine, and 2019 is my first real go of it ðŸ¤ž.
